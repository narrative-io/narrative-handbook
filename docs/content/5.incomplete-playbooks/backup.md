## Retention of Security Documentation and Audit Trails

## RDS Multi-Region Backup

> An automated process will back up all data to a separate region in the same country (e.g. US East to US West). By default, data will be backed up monthly. The backups are encrypted in the same way as live production data. 

By default, the RDS snapshots are created in the same region/same availability zone as the database. When creating a new database, it is important to replicate the snapshots to a different region. The replicated snapshot should use the KMS key of the other region.

## Source Code Repositories

> Source code repositories are backed up to Narrativeâ€™s AWS account on a monthly basis.

- All Github repositories need to be backed up to a different region (and encrypted if stored outside of S3)
