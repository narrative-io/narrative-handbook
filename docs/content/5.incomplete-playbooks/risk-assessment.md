##### Procedure for Assessing Risk Report Submissions
The **Risk Assessment Team** reviews and processes all Risk Report Submissions as follows:
1. Risk Report Submissions automatically generate a shortcut ticket in the [Security Workspace](https://app.shortcut.com/narrative-security/stories/space/21648/everything) to track the assessment.
   - title: `New Risk Report Submission`
   - shortcut label: `risk-assesment`
2. Once submitted, the Shortcut Ticket will be assigned an owner. (WIP)
3. The owner of the ticket will evaluate the submission complete the required fields (Columns M-W) in the tracker [Risk Report Submission (Responses)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hHac0R3c01yKDzuVoq9yiVRrnUVlSyig95ro1CT3eoY/edit#gid=447648162), consulting with the Risk Assessment Team as necessary.
4. Any remaining next steps for Treatment and/or Post-Treat Re-Evaluation steps will be documented and tracked by creating new ticket(s) within Shortcut.
5. The person who submitted the Risk Report Submission will be contacted to confirm that the risk has been assessed, and will be notified of any applicable next steps.
