## Handling Vulnerability Disclosure Submissions

The [:icon{name="openmoji:locked"} Vulnerability Management Policy](https://github.com/narrative-io/narrative-playbooks/blob/main/policies/vulnerability-management-policy.md#vulnerability-disclosure-program) describes the general guidelines and expectations for handling VDP submissions.

In practice, the following process is the one we use to handle these submissions:
1. Create a Shortcut ticket in the [:icon{name="openmoji:locked"} narrative-security](https://app.shortcut.com/narrative-security/) workspace and tag it using the [:icon{name="openmoji:locked"} Vulnerability Disclosure Program label](https://app.shortcut.com/narrative-security/label/22148).
   - Include the priority/severity in the description and fill the due date field based on its corresponding SLA in the [:icon{name="openmoji:locked"} table provided in the policy](https://github.com/narrative-io/narrative-playbooks/blob/main/policies/vulnerability-management-policy.md#priorityseverity-ratings-and-service-level-agreements). 
   - Assign the ticket to the person who is on the Security On-Call Rotation.
   - Attach a PDF print of the email / vulnerability report.
2. If the problem cannot be immediately addressed, reply to the vulnerability reporter with the estimate.
3. The person who is on the Security On-Call Rotation resolves or delegates the work and tracks it to completion.
4. Inform the vulnerability reporter of the fix and Cc `security@narrative.io`.
5. Include a PDF print of the email communication. 
6. Use Shortcut conventions to link corresponding PRs to the ticket.
