## Customer Policy

TODO

> If a customer account is involuntarily suspended, then there is a <X day> grace period during which the account will be inaccessible but can be reopened if the customer meets their payment obligations and resolves any terms of service violations.

> If a customer wishes to manually backup their data in a suspended account, then they must ensure that their account is brought back to good standing so that the user interface will be available for their use. After <X days>, the suspended account will be closed and the data will enter the “expired” state. It will be permanently removed <X days> thereafter (except when required by law to retain).
